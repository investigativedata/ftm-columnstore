ftm-columnstore
===============

This library provides methods to store, fetch and list entities
formatted as
```followthemoney`` <https://github.com/alephdata/followthemoney>`__
data as datasets stored in a column store backend using
`clickhouse <https://clickhouse.com/>`__

This roughly follows the functionality and features from
`followthemoney-store <https://github.com/alephdata/followthemoney-store>`__
but with a huge performance benefit on writing and querying data.

``FtM`` data is stored in one table in `statements <#statements>`__
format.

Usage
-----

Set up a running clickhouse instance (pointed to via ``DATABASE_URI``
env var, default: ``localhost``), for developing purposes this could
work:

::

   make clickhouse

Then initialize the required table schema:

::

   ftm cstore init

Or drop existing data and recreate:

::

   ftm cstore init --recreate

To test if itâ€™s working, run a raw query:

::

   ftm cstore query "SHOW TABLES"

When using the ``make clickhouse`` command, you can play around with SQL
queries in your browser: http://127.0.0.1:8123/play

Command-line usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(``ftm store`` becomes ``ftm cstore``)

.. code:: bash

   # Insert a bunch of FtM entities into a store:
   cat ftm-entities.ijson | ftm cstore write -d my_dataset
   # Re-create the entities in aggregated form:
   ftm cstore iterate -d my_dataset | alephclient write-entities -f my_dataset

::

   Usage: ftm cstore [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

     Store FollowTheMoney object data in a column store (Clickhouse)

   Options:
     --log-level TEXT  Set logging level  [default: info]
     --uri TEXT        Database connection URI  [default: localhost]
     --table TEXT      Database table  [default: ftm]
     --help            Show this message and exit.

   Commands:
     delete        Delete dataset or complete store
     fingerprints  Generate fingerprint statements as csv from json entities...
     flatten       Turn json entities from `infile` into statements in csv...
     init          Initialize database and table.
     iterate       Iterate entities
     list          List datasets in a store
     query         Execute raw query and print result (csv format) to outfile
     statements    Dump all statements as csv
     write         Write json entities from `infile` to store.

statements
^^^^^^^^^^

Under the hood, ``FtM`` entities are converted to statements, which is
possible via the command line too:

::

   cat entities.ijson | ftm cstore flatten > statements.csv

fingerprints
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Additionally write fingerprints for entity props with type
```name`` <https://followthemoney.readthedocs.io/en/latest/types.html#name>`__
to a dedicated fingerprint index, usable for very fast lookups:

::

   cat entities.ijson | ftm cstore write -d my_dataset --fingerprints

Python Library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

   from ftm_columnstore import Dataset

   dataset = Dataset("US-OFAC")
   dataset.put(entity)

   entity = dataset.get("entity-id")

Bulk writer behaves the same like in
```followthemoney-store`` <https://github.com/alephdata/followthemoney>`__:

.. code:: python

   from ftm_columnstore import Dataset

   dataset = Dataset("US-OFAC")
   bulk = dataset.bulk(with_fingerprints=True)

   for entity in many_entities:
     bulk.put(entity)
   bulk.flush()

Querying entities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There is some weird and unintuitive stuff going on building these
queries as turning the statements back into ``FtM`` entities is a bit
hacky here, but from top-level, it feels quite nice:

.. code:: python

   from ftm_columnstore.query import EntityQuery

   q = EntityQuery().where(schema="Person")
   # queries are always streaming result iterator
   entities = [e for e in q]

   # querying for properties:
   q = EntityQuery().where(schema="Payment", amount__gte=1000)
